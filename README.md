# ML_based_IR_drop_pred

This repository provides a **Machine Learningâ€“based IR drop prediction framework** for VLSI power grids.  
It combines **Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)** for ground truth voltage solving with a **U-Net** deep learning model to predict IR drop heatmaps from circuit features.
